## Maximilian Sieb

Hello! I am Max and a 2nd year student within the MSR program at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. 

My research is motivated by enabling robots to learn complex skills by leveraging human demonstrations. I mostly focus on visual imitation learning and model-based reinforcement learning.

### Publications

[Data Dreaming for Object Detection: Learning Object-Centric State Representations for Visual Imitation](pdf/ddfod.pdf) 

In this paper, we show we can use synthetically generated image data from only a few background-subtracted ground-truth images to built instance-specific object detectors robust to partial occlusions. Further, we demonstrate how we can use these detectors to imitate human demonstrations of manipulation tasks in a sample-efficient manner, where the overall imitation learning process takes less than 10 minutes.
