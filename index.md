## Maximilian Sieb

Hello! I am Max and a 2nd year student within the MSR program at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. 

My research is motivated by enabling robots to learn complex skills by leveraging human demonstrations. I mostly focus on visual imitation learning and model-based reinforcement learning.
